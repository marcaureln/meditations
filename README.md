# Meditations

## About

The idea of making this application came to me while I was reading Marcus Aurelius's Meditations. Like many readers, I usually highlight passages that hit me. But, this time, I wanted to have these passages next to me. I didn't want to take the book out of my library and delve into it to find a particular passage. I used to use note-taking apps like Google Keep, but when you start collecting a lot of quotes, things begin being messy. Furthermore, I wanted special features that these apps don't provide. So, that's why I decided to build my quotepad.
