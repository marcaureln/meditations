# Meditations

## About

The idea of making this application came to me while I was reading the meditations of Marcus Aurelius. I have the habit (like many readers) of underlining the passages that impressed me during the reading of a book. But with this one I wanted to have these passages at hand. I didn't want to take the book out of my library and rummage through it to find a particular passage. That's why I decided to make a quote notebook for myself.

Stay tuned for upcoming features like dark theme.

The application is fully available in both French and English.
